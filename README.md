## 📌 Key Highlights:
Revenue Growth: Revenue has shown a consistent upward trend, reflecting positive business growth. Busiest Days: Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays experience the highest footfall, aligning with the workweek trend when people are energized and prefer coffee breaks. Busiest Hours: Morning hours are the peak times, as customers frequent the coffee shops on their way to work.

## 📈 Top Insights:
Best-Selling Product: The top category is coffee, with Barista Espresso being the most popular product across all stores. Low-Performing Products: Certain flavors, coffee beans, and merchandise items show lower sales. For instance, merchandise clothing sales at the Astoria store are significantly lower than in other stores.

## 💡 Data-Driven Recommendations:
Discount Strategies: Introduce discounts or promotional offers on low-performing products at the Astoria store to boost sales. Inventory Optimization: Consider limiting in-store display of underperforming products, like merchandise clothing, and shift to an online order-only model. This can help reduce operational costs.
